    1    // Basic Mathematical Operations
    // Your task is to create a function that does four basic mathematical operations.
    //
    //     The function should take three arguments - operation(string/char), value1(number), value2(number).
    //     The function should return result of numbers after applying the chosen operation.
    //
    //     Examples:
    // basicOp('+', 4, 7)         // Output: 11
    // basicOp('-', 15, 18)       // Output: -3
    // basicOp('*', 5, 5)         // Output: 25
    // basicOp('/', 49, 7)        // Output: 7
    // reply

    // If the wolf is the closest animal to you, return "Pls go away and stop eating my sheep". Otherwise, return "Oi! Sheep number N! You are about to be eaten by a wolf!" where N is the sheep's position in the queue.
    //
    // Note: there will always be exactly one wolf in the array.
